# About me
I am a first year master student at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/)'s [Institute for Computational & Mathematical Engineering](https://icme.stanford.edu/) (ICME). I have a broad interest in applied statistics, probability theory and machine learning theory & application. My primary focuses are on statistical inference and probabilistic modeling, with its applications in with applications in data science and computational neuroscience. My recent research spans Bayesian nonparametrics in bioinformatics, self-similar stochastic processes, and probabilistic modeling for algorithmic trading systems.  Moreover, I'm particularly excited by the intersection of theory and application, which include statistical learning theory, probability theory, optimization, numerical computing and interpretable machine learning.

Before coming to Stanford, I earned my bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), where I majored in Pure Mathematics, Statistics and minored in Computer Science. I’ve been fortunate to work under the guidance of Prof. [Liqun Diao](http://liqundiao.com/) and [Yi Shen](https://sites.google.com/site/yishenenglish/), contributing to projects involving both bayesian statistics and probability theory.

Outside of study, I enjoy swimming 🏊‍♀️, cooking 👨‍🍳 and traveling 🗺. My MBTI is INTP.
